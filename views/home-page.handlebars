<!-- 1. a home page where you see the existing blogs posted if there is any. 
  the home page would have the logo on the right, the name right next to it or in the
  center but on the same section for sure.
  for this we need home page. 
  2. the nav bar would have a log in/sign up and log out button along with a home button.
  this could be the home page as well -->
